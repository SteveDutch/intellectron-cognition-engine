# intellectron-cognition-engine - final project for coders campus

# Project Outline: 
Organizing Knowledge with a JAVA Spring Boot, Hibernate & Security app

# Introduction: 

The goal of this project is to organize knowledge from articles read, making it easier to find, retrace, refer and cross refer to in later stages of writing. Endnote is an academic similar tool, but this app has a more mundane approach and is free of cost, and it is making it possible to build up your own personalised database.

Read something interesting? Written something brillant? So here's the place to bring it. Enter some comment and tags as well, give some reference to other articles or texts. 
Looking for something written or read? Search for it (via tag, title, ...), go through a list of saved texts. And when you found it, you'll get references back - and there's a chance for new discoveries from old read articles.

# Technologies 

* Java 17, JavaScript, HTML
* Spring Boot 3.5.6, Spring Security
* Bulma
* MariaDB / Hibernate for data base.

# Features:

- Imported texts are fully searchable.
- There will be screens for new entry, search, search results & Spring Security login
